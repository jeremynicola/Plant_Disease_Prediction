# Leaf Disease Prediction App ðŸŒ¿

This is a Streamlit app that predicts plant leaf diseases using a pre-trained Keras model.

## Features

- Upload a leaf image (jpg/png)
- Predict disease or healthy status
- Display confidence percentage
- Show horizontal bar chart of all class probabilities

## Files

- `app.py` â†’ Streamlit application
- `leaf_disease_model.keras` â†’ Trained Keras model
- `label_encoder.pkl` â†’ Class label mapping

## Dataset

- Original dataset: [PlantVillage Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease)
- Dataset is **not included** in this repository (large ~600MB)
- To train your own model, download dataset and follow training notebook instructions
